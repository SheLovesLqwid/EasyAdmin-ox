# 🔨 EASYADMIN WITH OX_LIB MENU 🔨

# NEW UPDATE! v1.0.0
This update brings a refreshed user interface for EasyAdmin, now powered by the Ox_lib menu. Be sure to have the necessary dependencies and configurations set up for the best performance.

This resource is based on **EasyAdmin** by [Blumlaut](https://github.com/Blumlaut) (I am **NOT** the original creator).

I’ve enhanced EasyAdmin by integrating the Ox_lib menu, making it easier and more intuitive to access your options through a modern, streamlined interface. Huge thanks to [Overextended](https://github.com/overextended) for their contribution to Ox_lib, which has significantly improved the menu experience.

I’ll keep this resource up-to-date to ensure compatibility with EasyAdmin, so everything I’ve added should always work smoothly.
